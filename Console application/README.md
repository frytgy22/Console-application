Presented a console application with the ability:
  - Read txt file and split it by lines.
  - Calculate statistics for each line and whole file: longest word (symbols between 2 spaces), 
  shortest word, line length, average word length, duplication of the words.
  - Store line and file statistic into DB (with JDBC).

How to use:
  - Run class Main to start application.
  - In the dialog window that appears, select a txt file from your PC to get statistics and write
   it to the db.
  
I use remote db, tables txt_file, statistics_for_each_line already exists.
